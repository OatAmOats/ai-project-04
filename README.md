# ai-project-04

fourth project from my AI course. This time we implemented Reasoning Under Uncertainty algorithms for the pacman game. Pacman would receive noisy sonar readings of about where each ghost is, and from that he has to figure out their locations. We used Exact Inference, Particle Filtering, and Joint Particle filtering for the case with many ghosts.

All of my work is in bustersAgents.py and inference.py
